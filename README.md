# beman.inplace\_vector: Dynamically-resizable vector with fixed capacity

![Continuous Integration Tests](https://github.com/bemanproject/inplace_vector/actions/workflows/ci_tests.yml/badge.svg)
![Code Format](https://github.com/bemanproject/inplace_vector/actions/workflows/pre-commit.yml/badge.svg)

## Implements

- [`inplace_vector` P0843R14](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p0843r14.html)

## Usage

### Definition in P0843

> `inplace_vector` is a dynamically-resizable array with capacity fixed
at compile time and contiguous inplace storage,
that is, the array elements are stored within the vector object itself.
Its API closely resembles `std::vector<T, A>`,
making it easy to teach and learn,
and the inplace storage guarantee makes it useful in environments in
which dynamic memory allocations are undesired.

### Code example

```cpp
// TODO: Add example
```

## How to Build

### Compiler support

Building this repository requires **C++17** or later.

### Dependencies

TODO: tested platforms.

### Instructions

<!-- TODO: add preset support -->

#### Manual CMake Build

```text

# Build

```

## Development

### Linting

This project use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework for linting.

#### Install pre-commit

```bash
pip3 install pre-commit
```

pre-commit can be configured to automatically triggered before git commit,
to install this functionality, run:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

#### Running pre-commit

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This will download and check linting rules on all files.
Apart from Markdown files,
`pre-commit` will automatically format the files
to conform with linting rules in place.
